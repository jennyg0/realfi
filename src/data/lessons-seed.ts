        content: `The stock market is like a giant marketplace â€” but instead of buying clothes or coffee, people buy and sell tiny pieces of companies called stocks. The market connects investors who want to buy and sell those shares every day.

Companies use this system to raise money, and investors use it to grow theirs. When you own a stock, you're literally a part-owner of that company. Prices go up and down every day based on what people think a company is worth, but over time, the market as a whole has historically grown â€” which is why investing consistently is so powerful.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'What you\'re buying',
        content: `Owning a stock means owning a share â€” a small fraction â€” of a company's total value.

When you invest in the stock market, there are two main ways to buy in: individual stocks and ETFs (exchange-traded funds).

**Individual stocks** mean you're buying shares of one company â€” like Apple or Shopify. If that company performs well, your investment can grow quickly. But if it struggles, your money can drop just as fast. It's higher risk, higher reward.

**ETFs** are bundles of many different stocks (sometimes hundreds) packaged into one investment. Instead of betting on one company, you're buying a piece of many â€” like owning a slice of the whole market. ETFs tend to grow steadily, with less volatility, making them a more stress-free choice for beginners.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'Why prices move',
        content: `Stock prices don't just change because a company made more money this quarter. They move because of expectations â€” what people believe will happen next. If investors think a company's future looks bright, demand for the stock rises, and so does the price. If confidence drops, prices can fall fast. That's why short-term movements can feel emotional â€” but zoom out, and you'll see that time rewards consistency over reaction.

Here's the good news for you: history shows that the stock market as a whole trends upward. Over the last century, the average long-term return of the stock market has been around 7â€“10% per year after inflation. That means even with occasional downturns, consistent investors typically see growth over time.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'How investors make money',
        content: `Most of your returns (the money you gain) will come from your investments growing in value â€” known as capital gains. For example, if you buy a stock at $100 and it rises to $130, you've earned a $30 gain.

Some companies also pay dividends, which are small cash payouts given to shareholders from the company's profits. Dividends typically range between 1% and 5% per year depending on the company. So while your main wealth comes from growth, dividends add steady income along the way â€” especially as your portfolio grows larger.`,
      },
      {
        title: 'What beginners should remember',
        content: `You don't have to be a stock-picking genius to invest. In fact, most successful investors simply buy broad funds that include many companies and hold them long-term. Small, steady investments can compound into something incredible over years.

Imagine you start investing $500 per month at age 30, earning a 7% average annual return. By age 60, that money could grow to over $610,000 â€” even though you only contributed $180,000 total. The rest comes from your money earning money over time.

The earlier you start, the harder your investments work for you. That's why experts say **time in the market beats timing the market**. You don't need to predict every move â€” you just need to keep showing up.`,

You can withdraw money anytime, and your balance won't fluctuate. It's not investing â€” it's simply a smarter way to let your unused cash earn a little extra while it waits for its next purpose.`,

        content: `A common hesitation when putting your money in a HISA for the first time is wondering if there's any risk of losing your money or seeing it drop, but a HISA balance never dips below what you put in.

So, how can a bank afford to pay you interest? Banks use the money you deposit to fund loans and mortgages. The bank earns interest from borrowers, then shares a small portion of that profit with you through your HISA interest rate. That's why your money isn't just sitting idle â€” it's helping the bank operate, while you safely earn a return for letting them use it.

And to ease your mind even more, most accounts are protected by deposit insurance.`,

      {
        title: 'HISA vs Investing',
        content: `Think of it like this: investing is about growing your future wealth, while a HISA is about protecting and optimizing your current cash.

Investing is about long-term growth with ups and downs along the way. A HISA is about stability â€” a guaranteed, predictable return. When you invest, your balance can rise or fall depending on the market. When you save in a HISA, your balance only moves in one direction: up.

A HISA is not meant to make you rich â€” it's meant to earn you a little extra risk-free on the money that can't be invested right now.`,

If you can't afford to risk it in the market or might need it quickly, it belongs in your HISA. Many people also use it as a holding spot for "cash in wait" â€” money they plan to invest soon but haven't yet decided where. It's your financial pause button: earning while it waits. A lot of HISA banks have now added more and more features, so some people keep all of their day-to-day cash in them too!`,

**Nickname your accounts:** Label them clearly â€” "Emergency Fund," "Next Trip," or "New Apartment."

**Set goal amounts:** Decide how much you want to save and use the built-in progress bars many banks now offer to keep you motivated.

**Automate it:** Set up automatic transfers from your main account so money moves into your HISA before you even think about spending it.

**Celebrate milestones:** Watching your balance grow, even slowly, builds momentum. Small consistent deposits often do more than one-time lump sums.

The more you personalize and automate your HISA, the easier it becomes to stay consistent â€” and consistency is what actually builds savings.`,

Here's how to personalize it:
1. Track your actual spending for a few months
2. Decide what "enough" looks like for you
